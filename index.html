            Hello World! I love and enjoy the process and creativity that comes
            with building websites and apps. I am a graduate of The University
            of Sydney and Trilogy’s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.
          </div>
          <div>
            During this course, I have acquired all necessary skills to build a
            full-stack website with languages such as React, MongoDB, Node.js,
            Express (MERN Stack) and many more listed below.
          </div>
          <div>
            I have had experience in building a website from scratch with other
            fellow web developers, so I understand the process and mindset
            behind building something from the bottom up as a team. I have also
            built a full-stack web application alone so I can further understand
            the process of being independent and relying on myself to achieve
            and accomplish what is needed to be done.

          <div class="description">
            Have you ever wanted to see results, reviews and summaries for a
            sport so you get on google search up Liverpool vs Manchester United
            results, but you just don’t get all the information you want, so you
            decide to search Liverpool vs Manchester United highlights. After
            watching that you want to see other people’s opinions and thoughts
            on the game so you go searching for that. Now you want to see the
            results for the NBA finals and this loop repeats. So much searching.
            Sport Spot solves that problem by having all that information in one
            spot quickly and reliably. The feature that makes this application
            stand out from other similar applications is that it has the widest
            range of sports. Can you think of another app that has sports from
            basketball, to football, to chess and even Esports.

            We all need some kind of help in our daily lives. That is how the
            society was built and prospered overtime. We believe the need to
            provide users with a platform to connect to their community and
            offer to help out, and share their skills. We also believe that
            users with difficult financial situations should still be able to
            seek help. This web application allows users who need help to post
            their task and also view and accept tasks posted by other users

            Banana Finder intendeds to solve the annoying situation when you

            It allows the user to identify the song and then adds value to the
            users experience by giving the more information about the artist and
            track.

            This is a social network API that uses MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js
            and Express.js to create a database that stores information of users
            and their thoughts. There are many actions you can do such as "GET
            ALL USERS", "GET USER BY ID", "CREATE USER", "UPDATE USER", "DELETE
            USER" and the same thing with thoughts and friends. You can use an
            app, such as Insomnia, to test these CRUD operations and see how
            this project works.
