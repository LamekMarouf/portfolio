          Hello World! I love and enjoy the process and creativity that comes
          with building websites and apps. I am a graduate of The University of
          Sydney and Trilogyâ€™s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. During this course, I
          have acquired all necessary skills to build a full-stack website with
          languages such as React, MongoDB, Node.js, Express (MERN Stack) and
          many more listed below. I have had experience in building a website
          from scratch with other fellow web developers, so I understand the
          process and mindset behind building something from the bottom up as a
          team. I have also built a full-stack web application alone so I can
          further understand the process of being independent and relying on
          myself to achieve and accomplish what is needed to be done.
